# Instacard online shopping
Repository for data analysis of shopping application data with Python exploration

## This project is an analysis of Instacart Grocery Basket Data. 


Stakeholders from Instacard were interested in the variety of their customers and purchasing behaviours.
## Goal
This is descriptive analysis of data using Numpy, Pandas, and Matplot to identify better marketing strategies for stakeholders.
The sales team was curious as to when the busiest days, hours, of the week were.
Which products are more popular, and which customers are ordering these products.
## Questions
* The distribution among users in regards to brand loyalty?
* Do customers with different loyalty status have different ordering habits?
* Do customers from different regions have different ordering habits?
* Does family status and age have an influence on ordering habits?

Note this is a project created via Careerfoundry via open source data.
